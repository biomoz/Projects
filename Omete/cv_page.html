                    <h3>Who is Omer Celebi?</h3>

                    <p>My name is Omer Celebi. I'm 20 years old. I'm Turkish and I live in Belgium. I speak English, Turkish and Dutch. </p>
                    <p>My hobbies are playing video games, fitness and programming. I'm interested in technology and games. Right now I'm trying to learn programming with all I can so that I can work as a programmer in the future.</p> 
                    <p>The reason why I got interested in programming comes from my childhood. When I was a child I would play games or install things to my computer and one in a while there would be some errors accuring. I liked solving those kind of problems and fixing things by typing code into the command line or fixing files with other applications.</p>
                    <p>Right now I'm studying in the ICT faculty of Thomas More University with the specialization of Application Development. For my highschool, I graudated from ASO Sint Michielsinstituut Keerbergen in 2021.</p>
                    <p>During highschool, I had taken extra classes for programming. So I have some knowladge about programming. I have done a basic and small game project during highschool. Other than that I haven't done any projects before starting university. Right now I'm working on three projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. LockCent: A application and a website that lets you store your passwords and notes in a safe environment.</li>
                    <li>2. Red-Shut: An Arduino project that lets you draw in a 8x8 LED matrix and also play a game similar to Battleship.</li>
                    <li>3. Omete: A website that presents my work and information and shows how much I know about web engineering.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While I try to code and create new things I'm still new to programming so I lack knowledge. But I'm eager to learn so I hope I will be succesful.</p>
